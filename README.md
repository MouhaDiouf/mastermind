# Mastermind Game

> A Mastermind Game Built With Ruby

## About Mastermind

The game is played using:

1. a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
2. code pegs of six different colors (or more; see Variations below), with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and key pegs, some colored black, some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the small holes on the board.

The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number.([wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>))
